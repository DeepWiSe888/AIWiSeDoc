# Sleep Tracker
## Introduction
Track your sleep accurately without the discomfort of a wristband or electrode wires.
* Some Problem
  CDC has recently classified insufficient sleep as a public health problem. Sleepiness is the root cause of increasing the risk of accidents and other occupational errors. It can also cause health concerns such as diabetes, depression and high blood pressure.
  According to a recent survey by the National Sleep Foundation and the Consumer Electronics Association, more than 60% of sleep tracking technology owners are more aware of their sleep patterns after sleep tracking. 51% of sleep tracking technology owners say theyâ€™re sleeping better knowing the technology is helping them and 49% say they feel healthier since they started using the technology.
  Although most of the sleep tracking technologies are non-invasive devices such as watches and bands, they still require huge amounts of daily maintenance for hygiene and constant battery charging. The discipline of frequent charging and hygiene maintenance using the wearable device has turned a lot of people away from using them.
* The Solution
  Using Walabot, we can build a non-invasive sleep tracking system that's always on. This way the User does not have to worry about charging their wearables, washing for hygiene and still be able to track a good night's sleep.

#### 2.Building the Development Environment 
Requirements:
* Python 3.6+ 
* Cython 0.26+
* Numpy 1.13+
* cmake
  
#### 3.Installation SDK on Raspberry Pi
We need to install the radar SDK on our Raspberry Pi. To do this we first grab the installer for Raspberry Pi from this page on the Walabot site.Then we follow the instructions found on this other page in order to run it and complete the installation of the radar SDK:
```shell
    sudo
```

####  4.Run the demo
